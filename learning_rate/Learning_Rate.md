# Whats Learning Rate?

Learning Rate is a crtical hyperpameter when it comes training deep learning models. Adaptive learning rates can help the parameters to converge faster to local minima optimal values.

> Note: In PyTorch, optim.lr_scheduler is a module that provides various strategies for adjusting the learning rate during training. These learning rate schedulers allow you to change the learning rate of the optimizer at specific intervals, which can help the model converge better and faster, especially during the later stages of training.
